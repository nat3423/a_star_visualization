Description: A visualization of the A* pathfinding algorithm
Usage: Run main. First select the starting point, then the ending point.
        Once those are selected, any further clicks will make a square 
        impassable. Right-clicking will remove the current square. Space
        starts the algorithm, and 'c' will clear the entire board.
